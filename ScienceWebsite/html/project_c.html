              HARNESSING HUMAN ENERGY REFLECTION REQUIREMENTS & PLANNING:
              
  - what skill did this project improve?
    - presenting skills: this was the first project in the year that we had to present
      and I think it taught us a lot of valuable techniques for later projects in other
      subjects

  - what did you like about the project?
    - it was nice to apply my interests to Science again and build a circuit for the project

  - what does this website slide need to include?
    - video of the project and what the final product was
      - text explaining what the purpose of the project is and how the video relates to it.
        Essentially just an explanation of what's going on.
    - images of the theory and research of what makes the 'human energy harnesser' work
      - maybe an image of DC and AC current and a bridge rectifier
      - also a text explaining bridge rectifiers, breadboards, and DC and AC currents

      <h2>About The Project</h2>
      <p>
        The 'Harnessing Human Energy' project focused on developing innovative systems to 
        provide a reliable mobile charging solution for a rescue team. Our approach involved 
        harnessing human energy by converting kinetic energy generated from walking into 
        electrical energy using a pressure sensor. This energy could then be utilised to 
        charge devices without the need for a traditional power source.
